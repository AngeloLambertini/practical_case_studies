### SocialBuzz Case Study

The customer, SocialBuzz, provided three different excel datasets regarding their social platform: Content, Reactions, ReactionTypes.
The data were condemsed in a single database through the VLOOKUP excel function selecting only the columns of interest.
The data were then cleaned by removing rows with null values, formatting the categories names to avoid categories overlapping, and extracting year and month from "datetime" column.
Since the customer's aim is to identify the top performing content categories and find insights about the user's behavior, different types of graphs were produced with excel highlighting trends in content and reactions posting.
